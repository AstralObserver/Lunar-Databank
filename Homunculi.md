Homunculi are a relatively newly discovered form of entity which have abilities beyond what would typically be considered as natural. While the exact methods through which they are able to achive these unique abilities is unclear, the source is believed to be a notable difference in their bodies compared with traditional materials and traditional bio/mechanical structures.

Homunculi are not born naturally. They are not capable of producing biological offspring with any species, including other eidolons or species that seem to share biological traits. In the rare case that a Homunculi is tied to the birth of a child, that child is a derivative of the suitors species, not an Homunculi itself.

Rather, Homunculi are created when certain rare conditions are met. The formation process has a distinct impact on the kind of Homunculi created which fall into several key categories.

# 1. Forms of Homunculi

## 1.1. Tulpa
A newly formed being constructed fully by the imagination of an individual with characteristics and abilities defined by the creator's initial thoughts during the creation of the Tulpa. Typically, once a Tulpa reaches a stable form for a period of time it will become 'solidified' in such a way that the creator cannot further alter the entity or guide it's actions. At this point, the Tulpa is typically fully autonomous, no longer requiring thought from it's maker to act and possibly deviating from it's initial characteristics as it develops on it's own and forms a sense of self.

## 1.2. Simulacrum
A Homunculi that is a newly formed imitation of something or someone that already exists. While reflective of some previously existing entity, a simulacrum is, by the nature of homunculi, a new being formed based on the thoughts and perceptions of an individual. As a result, while simulacrum may bear a strong resemblance to the pre-existing thing under ideal circumstances, it is very possible for a simulacrum to behave/appear significantly different from the initial entity it was meant to represent.

## 1.3. Persona
A Homunculi that is not newly formed, but instead an alteration of something that already existed with previous traits becoming exaggerated, altered, or reduced in some manner. Like any homunculi, the traits that are altered shift in such a way that they match the former entities perception, the perception of another, or the perception of a group.
