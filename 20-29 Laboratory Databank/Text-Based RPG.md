#### 2.1.1.2. Character Features

Features are ways to make a character distinct and give them new abilities beyond improvements to the standard array of stats, skills, and gear. These can take characters in specific directions, as some features unlock new better features down the line.

### 2.1.2. Leveling Up
#### 2.1.2.1. Spending EXP
The actions a character completes sometimes give Experience (EXP) to the character. Over time, that EXP can be converted into certain benefits to the character. There are three primary ways to spend EXP to improve a character. Increasing Stats, increasing Skills, and buying Features.

**Stat Improvements**
Stats can be improved by spending EXP to gain Statpoints. These can be added to any Stat to increase it's Tier by 1. Stat points become increasingly expensive to get, so be mindful of where you put them. Higher Tier Stats cost more Statpoints to get.

| Statpoint | EXP Cost |
| --------- | -------- |
| 1         | 1000     |
| 2         | 2000     |
| 3         | 4000     |
| 4         | 8000     |
| 5         | 16000    |
| 6         | 32000    |
| 7         | 64000    |
| 8         | 128000   |

| Tier  Level | Tier One | Tier Two | Tier Three | Tier Four | Tier Five | Tier Six |
| ----------- | -------- | -------- | ---------- | --------- | --------- | -------- |
| Skillpoints | 1        | 2        | 4          | 8         | 16        | 32       |


**Skill Improvements**
Skills can be improved by spending EXP to gain Skillpoints. These Skillpoints can be put into a skill in order to increase it's tier by paying a certain number of Skillpoints. 

Each purchased Tier gives a bonus to any checks associated with the skill equal to the currently unlocked Tier.

| Tier  Level | Tier One | Tier Two | Tier Three | Tier Four | Tier Five | Tier Six |
| ----------- | -------- | -------- | ---------- | --------- | --------- | -------- |
| Skillpoints | 1        | 2        | 4          | 8         | 16        | 32       |
| EXP Cost    | 100      | 200      | 400        | 800       | 1600      | 3200     |
| Total EXP   | 100      | 300      | 700        | 1500      | 3100      | 6300     |
