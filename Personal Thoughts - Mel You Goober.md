If you want to find friends with certain traits, partners with certain thoughts and ways of dealing with things/each other, then go to the places where those kinds of people *are* you goober. If you want a partner with good programming skills and a healthy disposition, or anarchist disposition, go to forums and/or events where THEY WILL ATTEND. Why the fuckk are you still only going to the events that stress you out? Only making plans with those goobers? Yes, spend time with them, but spend less time planning events for ALL of them and more time just.. letting them talk and meetup. On call go do the things you want, but still chill with them if you want!
