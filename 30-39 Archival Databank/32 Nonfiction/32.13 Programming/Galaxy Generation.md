Solar System

# 1. [Stars](https://naturalsciences.ch/astronomy-explained/celestial_bodies/stars/types_of_stars)
Stars are classified in the modern day by the Morgan-Keenan (MK) classification system based on their surface temperature and luminosity. Their surface temperature determines the color of the star while the luminosity is dependent on the radii of the star.
## 1.1. Spectral Classes - Temperature is degrees Celsius
O - 40,000+ - Blue
B - 20,000+ - Blue-White
A - 9,000+ - White
F - 7,000+ - White-Yellow
G - 5,500+ - Yellow
K - 4,000+ - Orange
M - 3,000+ - Red-Orange

## 1.2. Luminosity - Solar Units are the Luminosity Measurement
I - 10,000-1,000,000 - Supergiant
II - 1,000-10,000- Bright Giant
III - 100-1,000 - Giant
IV - 10-100 - Subgiant
V - 0.001-10 - Dwarf

# 2. [(Exo)Planets](https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanets/planet-types/)
Exoplanets (planets outside of our solar system) are categorized by a variety of different methods with no universally recognized taxonomy. However, one common method is to group based on mass/radius and temperature.
## 2.1. Size Classes
Me = Earth Mass
Re = Earth Radius

### 2.1.1. Terran
Miniterran - 10^-5 - 0.1 Me *or* 0.03-0.4 Re
Subterran - 0.1-0.5 Me *or* 0.4-0.8 Re
Terran - 0.0-5 Me *or* 0.8-1.5 Re
Superterran - 5-10 Me *or* 1.5-2.5 Re

### 2.1.2. Gas Giant
Neptunian - 10-50 Me *or* 2.5-6.0 Re
Jovian - > 50 Me *or* > 6 Re

## 2.2. Temperature Zones
