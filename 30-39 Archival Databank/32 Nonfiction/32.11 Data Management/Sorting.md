Generally speaking, sorting refers to the process of ordering data in an increasing or decreasing manner according to some linear relationship among the data items.

There are two methods for sorting:
- Ordering: Arranging items in a sequence by some criterion.
- Categorizing: Grouping items together with similar properties (Then ordering the categories).
