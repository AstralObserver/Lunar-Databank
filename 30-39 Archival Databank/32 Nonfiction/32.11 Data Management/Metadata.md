Any data that provides information about another type of data but not being contained within it is Metadata. This comes in a variety of forms that are all useful for understanding what a set of data contains without analyzing it.

- Descriptive: Descriptive information about a data source. Used for discovery and identification and includes titles, abstracts, authors, and keywords/tags.
- Structural: Indicates how compound objects are put together in a container, like how pages form chapters. This form of data includes the types, versions, relationships, and other characteristics of digital materials.
- Administrative: Includes information to help manage a resource, resource type, permissions, and when/how it was created.
- Reference: Includes information about the contents and quality of statistical data.
- Statistical (Process): Includes description of processes that collect, process, or produce statistical data.
- Legal: Includes information about the creator, copyright holder, and public licensing.
