# Summary
The Biphrol Station is the first instance of a stable inter-galactic station ever created. It stands as a testament to the power of one of the largest alliances in the Milky Way Galaxy. 

# History
Created by the most powerful alliance in the Milky Way galaxy, so strong was their hold within their home galaxy that they were able to dedicated a vast amount of resources to finally closing the gap between galaxies.

The creation of the station involved a large number of wormhole 'drilling' attempts to create a wormhole path with optimal travel time between the Milky Way Galaxy and some location wthin Andromeda. The test that was finalized had an endpoint located in the Mayall II Sector, chosen both due to the speed of the path being ideal in higher dimensional distance and leading to a location within a solar system centered in a matter hotbed within the star-dense sector.

Once located, the designs for a seed ship were finalized, built, and sent through the wormhole in order to construct a more stable connection at the other mouth of the wormhole. This solidified the connection between galaxies and served as a foundation for the Mayall II Sector, devouring the asteroid belt to get the raw materials needed and giving birth to a fully synthetic organic species to increase the Ichor/Aether potential of the region enough to power the newly constructed Biphrol Station.
