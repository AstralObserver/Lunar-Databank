Seed ships are  form of advanced Von Neumann comprised of, at minimum, a computer system and production system capable of extracting resources, refining materials, constructing replications of itself, and guiding it's copies towards some objective.

Seed ships can range from quite simple for mining and resource extraction to extremely complex for terraforming and wartime efforts. 

Initial design considerations typically include the complexity of the task with more complex tasks requiring a stronger computational framework and longer planning timeframe, the amount of information known about the task/location the probe will be entering, and the amount of initial facilities that should be included. A finalized seed ship has all of the required schematics and faculties to complete some objective from start to finish, and if it doesn't, it has the capability to produce them. The idea is that once sent out, a seed ship will be able to be "left to it's own devices" until it finished it's task and sends a return signal upon completion. These are quite expensive to construct and are typically only made by the excessively wealthy and sent out far ahead of future sentient-lead missions.
