The Ichorweaver Syndicate is a loose conglomerate of corporations and research teams dedicated to finding new ways of manipulating Ichor/Aether. While each group has it's own ethical considerations, the group is known for creating and maintaining a technology known as the Akashic Record. This is a sort of "archive" of any/all information that is stored across a network of lower dimensional universes in the Ichor/Aether connected via strands that run through our dimension and into the higher dimension. This structure allows one to add any and all form of new information to the network by storing it in ichor/aether and connecting it to the network via specialized technology. Just so, any connected information can be removed by severing those strands or accessed from anywhere at near-instantaneous speed so long as one has at least one connected thread.
