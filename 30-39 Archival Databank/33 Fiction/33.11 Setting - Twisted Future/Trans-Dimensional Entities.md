When using [[Aether]] to interact with higher or lower planes, there are certain re-occurring phenomena that occur with similar patterns but no standard formulaic rule for repeating the result. These interactions are thought to be the result of certain higher-dimensional intelligence interacting with our universe. 

It is unclear how many entities actually exist or what form they might take. As a result, interactions are defined by the nature of the interaction rather than attempting to quantify what entity is being interacted with. 
# Levels of Interaction
## Higher to Standard

Interactions that can happen anywhere at any time, thought to occur when an entity is connecting to our universe from the universe 'above' ours from which we are one mote of Aether.

## Standard to Lower

Interactions that happen when manipulating Aether in a specific location and time, thought to occur when our interactions are affecting a universe 'below' ours or when a universe 'below' ours is interacting with our universe.

# Types of Interaction
## Cognitive

Interactions occurring when a particular pattern of thought, behavior, or idea is explored. These may be physically present in the way a creature interacts with the world, but also may be purely internal. 

Higher cognitive interactions are particularly random and hard to predict as any thought at any time in any place has the potential to trigger a cognitive interaction.

Lower cognitive interactions are typically linked to certain core themes occurring alongside the presence of Aether. The most commonly cited form of this type of interaction is in the form of [[Homunculi]]

## Physical

Interactions occurring when energy or matter is taken, gained, or manipulated as a result of interactions between planes.

Higher physical interactions frequently take place during travel through [[Wormholes]] as objects briefly pass through the space between the universe above ours, into that universe, into the space between, and into our universe again at a new location. Higher level physical interactions are also linked to energy/matter creation and destruction, thought to be the movement of energy or matter from the higher universe into ours.

Lower physical interactions also occur with energy/matter creation and destruction when siphoning either from the Aether, or lower universes.
