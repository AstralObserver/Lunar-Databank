Defined the collapse of modern civilization due to a mixture of climate change, global conflict, disease, and radiation.

## 1.1. The Climate and Energy Crisis

In the 21st century the globe was facing a variety of issues due to the heating world and rapid depletion of natural oil and gas reserves. While developing nations struggled to cope with the economic and population damaging effects of climate change, developed nations began to experiment more with nuclear fusion technologies. 

While they did begin to transition, this shift was rushed due to the urgent need for the solutions. This left the infrastructure supporting them weakened from the start while developed nations struggled to keep up with the resources they had. This strain resulted in an uptick of conflict, especially between developed nations and developing nations. Groups from developed nations would make regular attempts to disrupt nuclear plants, but defense was *generally* maintained for a long duration.
## 1.2. The Calamities

The calamities began when an earthquake on the southeastern United States resulted in a major nuclear disaster. As the government attempted to deal with the widescale disaster, their military posture weakened and the UN that relied on the US as their sword and shield was faced with a rapid pullback of the forces that defended their own nuclear assets.

This provided many rebel groups from developed nations to launch campaigns that devastated many more nations by taking control of nuclear plants. Some of these attacks failed and led to the plants being intentionally melted down rather than loosing the strategic hold they had temporarily gained. This, combined with another major earthquake in eastern Asia resulted in massive radioactive contamination across the global north and a number of regions in the global south. After a death toll in the low billions a mass migration to safer regions saw a 

## 1.3. The Outbreak

It's thought that the Outbreak began in one of the United States settlements, but it's effects were not known immediately due to food reserves being semi-stable for a time. It was noted that minor mutations were beginning to be seen across all of the surviving regions over a series of years with some reports of higher than normal rates of temporary psychosis amongst refugee groups suffering from a calorie deficit. This became a more common occurrence as the mutations became more prevalent and were linked to a symbiotic viral agent. These mutations resulted in an uptick of caloric needs that were difficult to account for.

As harvests became poorer with a lack of non-irradiated land, mass psychosis events were recorded across many settlements and reports of cannibalism became widespread. Many settlements either collapsed or were forced to disband and migrate before caloric deficiencies became too high and triggered another event. This led to a period that became known as the Second Dark Ages where only small groups of civilization were possible connected by telecommunications.

# 2. Post-Apocalypse

## 2.1. The Silver Age

The first proper cities to reform were only able to do so once radiation in regions subsided and massive improvements in agriculture/sustainability were achieved. Due to the nature of the mutations requiring a higher amount of calories to maintain without psychosis, it was crucial that resources were divided by need regardless of issues like race, class, or productivity. With this in mind, the cities that did form were based around more socialist principles.

The cities that did form began to strengthen connections by radio and rudimentary internet long before any direct supply lines were created. Through these points of contacts they were able to share what practices were successful and which ones created additional problems. While the sharing of knowledge and technology was much slower and more uneven, loose connections began to form along long abandoned roadways and clearings. There was additional difficulty due to the more heavily mutated humans found as individuals or small disconnected settlements between cities. Due to the length of time that had passed, communication was hard and sometimes impossible with groups that had become more feral in nature. That, and certain regions still had radiation levels that were far too hazardous to travel through.
