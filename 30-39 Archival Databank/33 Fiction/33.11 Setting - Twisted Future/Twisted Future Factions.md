# Faction Classifications

Factions can range drastically scope from the smallest tribe on a backwater planet to sprawling inter-dimensional civilizations. All factions of any tier share some unifying goal that any sub-factions also share. 

The following system for classifying factions is not the only way to do so, but is the most common way to gauge the power of a faction.

## First Tier

A relatively small population that need not necessarily be sapient with some shared goal. 

Scope: Covers groups that could fill a small building all the way to groups that control a single geographical region.

Common Traits
- Peer to Peer Interaction
- Shared Environmental Interaction

## Second Tier

A group of individuals with one or multiple First-Tier factions within it that share a unified goal.

Scope: Covers groups that control anything from a handful of geographical areas to a full planet.

Common Traits:

## Third Tier

Scope: Covers groups that control anything from a single planet and it's orbiting bodies to a full solar system.

## Fourth Tier

Scope: Covers groups that control anything from a handful of solar systems to an entire sector of a galaxy.

## Fifth Tier

Scope: Covers groups that control anything from several sectors of a galaxy to an entire galaxy.

## Sixth Tier

Scope: Covers groups that control anything from a few footholds in multiple galaxies to full control over several galaxies.

## Seventh Tier

Scope: Covers groups that go beyond the scope of the previous classifications.
