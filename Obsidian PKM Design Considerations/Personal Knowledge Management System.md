# 1. Introduction to Personal Knowledge Management Systems

A Personal Knowledge Management System (PKMS) is a tool that functions like a library, giving structure to knowledge in a way that makes it easy to recognize patterns and connections in a process known as [[Personal Knowledge Management]]. It is a bottom-up approach to [[Knowledge Management]] of a person's [[Personal Knowledge Base]].  

Personal Knowledge Management consists of the following core activities:

**Information Processing**

1. Discovery - Finding new information by reading, listening, or otherwise observing something.
2. Capture - Taking key information from a source and recording it to be stored in some location. Including storing pertinent information about the source of the information for finding it again later.
3. Curation/Indexing - Deciding where the new information belongs and storing it in a pre-defined structured format
4. Retrieval - Pulling information from the PKMS in order to complete tasks or re-learn topics.

**Information Review**

1. Assessment - Investigating the structure of the PKM to discover patterns. 
	- Find strong points (lots of connecting threads) and weak points (disconnected threads).
	- Find outdated knowledge by checking the when certain information was recorded/updated.
2. Evaluation - Determine the source of the pattern and decide what to refine, remove, or add connections to.
3. Adjustment - Make the alterations decided upon in the evaluation step to streamline the information stored in the Personal Knowledge Management System.

# 2. Personal Knowledge Management System Organization

Having one page for notes on a subject might be a good way to organize a small concept, but larger subjects may need multiple pages to explain an idea. In fact, one may wish to draw connections from connected ideas back towards a larger subject or connect two related ideas from different subjects together. 

If you start a new subject, you'll probably want a new page to start from and some way to know that this file is from a different topic than the first without having to look through a mess of pages.

There are various methods for finding the best way to organize data like these pages using an assortment of different tools from titles to tags. Bringing order to data like this is the domain of [[Data Management]].


> [!NOTE] To Be Moved
> Organizing this data is also called [[Sorting]] and is the foundation of [[Information Systems]].

Established Strategies
PARA Method: The PARA method is a method designed to be action oriented. It is defined by four regions designated to a specific task.
	Structure
	-  Projects: Specific tasks that are being worked on right now: Work Projects, Personal Projects, Side Projects
	- Area: Specific commitments that are more long-term: Finances, Home, Family
	- Resources: Specific items that are to be referenced in the future: Topics of Interest, Subjects of Research
	- Archives: Items that are completed/on hold.
	  ___________________________
	Intake Path
	1. Which project will this be most useful in?
	2. If none: Which area will this be most useful?
	3. If none: Which resource does this belong to?
	4. If none: Archive

[[Johnny Decimal System]]: This is a hierarchical organizational system designed to create a hierarchy that avoids any one topic becoming excessively deep/messy and requiring additional searches.
Benefits:
- It limits the maximum possible searches to 3 to find a location where data is stored.
- Allows quick-navigation by creating unique reference number between 00.00 and 99.99.

ACCESS Method: This system was built to turn 'encounters' into 'expression'. That is to say it is designed to allow a person to move from first thinking of an idea or finding something to eventually taking actions that align with your goals.

Structure
- Encounters: Designed to capture fleeting ideas or tidbits for future processing.
- Atlas: Used to gather data, develop the PKMS structure, and navigate the PKMS.
	- Maps of Content
	- Dashboards
	- Overviews
	- Logs
	- Datascopes
- Calendar: Used for logging, tracking, and reviewing time-oriented information
	- Daily Notes
	- Meetings
	- Plans
	- Reviews
	- Journals
- Cards: Used to build and connect ideas within the PKMS.
	- Ideas
	- Things
	- People
	- Concepts
	- Statements
- Extras: Houses all supporting material within the PKMS.
	- Attachments
	- Graphics
	- Images
	- Manuals
	- Templates
- Sources: Houses all connections to external ideas
	- Writing: Books, Articles, Research Papers
	- Audio: Podcasts, Talks
	- Video: Movies, TV, Videos
	- Multimedia: Courses
- Spaces: Used to manage your actions
	- (M) Map's of Content: 
	- (A) Areas: 
	- (P) Projects: 
	- (S) Support Notes
