Data Management is broadly defined as the careful managing of an data so it can be analyzed for decision making. The practice was first considered in the 1980s as data storage allowed discreet facts to be rapidly pulled from computer storage. Before this, metadata was used in [[Card Catalogs]].

In the modern day, Data Management is used anywhere from libraries to personal computers to databases. Data management can only be done through the utilization of [[Metadata]] to find data from relevant criteria, identify resources, bringing similar resources together, distinguishing dissimilar resources, and giving location information.

Here is a list of some common modern tools for sorting information:
- [[Tags]]: Assigned keywords or labels to information
- [[Metadata]]: Key/Value pairs where one key may have multiple possible va;ies
- [[Folders]]: Bins for placing information together
- [[Backlinks]]: Creating links from one piece of information directly to another

Each of those tools can help a user or program sort sift through data quickly to find the specific piece of information that they are looking for. However, like any tool there are certain ways in which to use them with certain benefits and drawbacks. There are a number of common methods for organizing data that can be facilitated by one or many of the aforementioned tools.

The following are a list of methodologies for organizing data: 
- Location: By the object's physical location. (Folder)
- Chronological: By time association to object. (Creation/Edit Time)
- Alphabetical: By the ordering of characters. (Title)
- Topic/Category: By pre-determined groupings. (Tags)
- Hierarchy: By pre-determined ordered groupings. (Mult-Tags/Folders)

Structures
- Random: Notes are all stashed in the same place with no defined structure. Search is used to find the documents as needed and tags/keywords may be used to query the pool.
- Chained Center (Daily Notes): A core "Chain" of nodes forms as the central point of the system. New nodes can only be created from one of the chain nodes, but can be connected to other nodes as well. 
	- An example is creating a "Daily" note for each day and adding/connecting "Idea" nodes for things that come up during that day. Allows chronological / otherwise ordered sorting.
- Content First (Atomic): Create a new page for every time you work on something. Connect nodes when natural associations between the newly created page and previous pages are formed.
	- Zettelkasten: A branching tree of permanent nodes starting from a core topic and subdividing as topics are learned. Bridging links connect different branching trees together.
- Topic First: Create a separate Index-Page/Log/Map of Content for key topics. When creating a new page, sort it into one of the existing key topics.
- Action First: Notes are organized based on the context in which it will most likely be used next (Capture, Curation, Assessment : Browse Etsy for X, Collect Options, Add Item to Wishlist, Purchase Item)
