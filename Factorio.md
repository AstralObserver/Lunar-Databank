For calculating the necessary materials required from a certain resource, start by picking the end goal and work backwards along the chain recursively.

Process of Calculation:
1. Decide Required Output
2. Define Initial Equation
	a. Output Resource
	b. Time to Construct
	c. Buildings Required
	d. Input Required
3. Repeat Initial Equation for each Input

y = output
t = time
x_ = input_


Input/Output W/ Respect to Time
T = Seconds to Craft
(Output/T) = (Input(s)/T)
